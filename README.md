# Hotel website

This is a customer facing hotel website showcasing a hotel and allowing users to register and book reservations, based on available dates and rooms. It is linked to the same Supabase backend as the hotel-admin website, which can be found on my page.

## Features:

Rooms section, where each room can be explored and booked, based on available dates.
An about section with a short description of the property.
A guest area, where users can register and sign in using Google OAuth, then manage their account and reservations.

### How it works

Explore the rooms, check for available dates, select your reservation details, then book your stay, if you are logged in to the account.

### Tech/frameworks used:

HTML/CSS  
Javascript  
React  
Next.js
